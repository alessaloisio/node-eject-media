# node-eject-media
Safely eject media on Windows, OSX, and Linux

In its present state, this project simply combines:

* https://github.com/jviotti/node-umount
* with a windows binary, [EjectMedia](http://www.uwe-sieber.de/drivetools_e.html)

Original authors above deserve all credit.

This is a WIP. Use at your own risk until package reaches 1.0 status.
